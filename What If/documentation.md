## User Guide

### Adding New Content

#### Adding New Beats

To add new beats to the website, edit the `data.js` file and add a new entry to the `beats` array:

```javascript
{
  id: 7, // Increment from the last ID
  title: "Your Beat Title",
  genre: "Genre", // e.g., Hip-Hop, Trap, R&B
  bpm: 90, // Beats per minute
  key: "C Minor", // Musical key
  audioFile: "audio/beat7.mp3", // Path to audio file
  coverArt: "images/beat7.jpg", // Path to cover image
  description: "Description of your beat",
  tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"] // Keywords for SEO
}
```

After adding the entry, upload the corresponding audio file to the `audio/` directory and the cover image to the `images/` directory.

#### Adding New Remixes

To add new remixes, add a new entry to the `remixes` array in `data.js`:

```javascript
{
  id: 5, // Increment from the last ID
  title: "Your Remix Title",
  originalArtist: "Original Artist Name",
  genre: "Genre",
  bpm: 110,
  youtubeEmbed: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID",
  coverArt: "images/remix5.jpg",
  description: "Description of your remix",
  tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
}
```

#### Adding New Cover Art

To add new cover art, add a new entry to the `coverArt` array in `data.js`:

```javascript
{
  id: 9, // Increment from the last ID
  title: "Your Cover Art Title",
  artist: "Your Name",
  image: "images/cover9.jpg",
  description: "Description of your cover art",
  tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
}
```

### YouTube to Website Auto-Posting

The website includes a system to automatically create new beat entries when you upload a video to YouTube. This functionality is implemented in the `setupYouTubeAutoPosting()` function in `seo-automation.js`.

In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Set up a YouTube API application
2. Configure webhook notifications for new uploads
3. Connect the webhook to your website's server
4. Process incoming video data using the `handleNewYouTubeVideo()` function

For demonstration purposes, the current implementation simulates this process.

### Ad Monetization Configuration

The ad system is configured in `ad-system.js` and `ad-integration.js`. To use your own AdSense account:

1. Replace the placeholder publisher ID in `window.adConfig.adsensePublisherId` with your actual AdSense publisher ID
2. Replace the placeholder ad unit IDs in `window.downloadAdConfig` with your actual ad unit IDs
3. Adjust ad placement and frequency as needed

### A/B Testing

The download system includes A/B testing to determine whether users prefer watching ads or subscribing to your newsletter. The system tracks:

- Number of downloads via ad views
- Number of downloads via email subscriptions
- Conversion rates for each option

Results are stored in local storage and can be viewed in the browser console. In a production environment, you would connect this to an analytics service.

## Customization

### Changing the Theme

The website uses a dark theme by default. To modify the theme:

2. To create a light theme, duplicate `dark.css` as `light.css` and modify the color variables
3. To switch themes, change the `dark-theme` class on the `<body>` element to your new theme class

### Customizing the Logo and Branding

1. Replace "Music Channel" in the navbar with your channel name
2. Update the hero section text and call-to-action
3. Modify the color scheme in `css/style.css` by changing the CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #8c52ff; /* Main brand color */
  --secondary-color: #5e17eb; /* Secondary brand color */
  --accent-color: #00d9ff; /* Accent color for highlights */
  /* Additional variables... */
}
```
